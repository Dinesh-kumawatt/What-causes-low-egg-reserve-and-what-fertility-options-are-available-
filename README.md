# What-causes-low-egg-reserve-and-what-fertility-options-are-available-

Low ovarian reserve (diminished ovarian reserve) means fewer available eggs and can be caused by age (most common), genetic factors, prior ovarian surgery, chemotherapy/radiation, autoimmune conditions, or certain medical diagnoses. It’s commonly evaluated with tests such as anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), antral follicle count (AFC) on ultrasound, and baseline FSH/estradiol. Treatment options depend on age, ovarian reserve, and patient goals: tailored ovarian stimulation protocols for IVF (sometimes using higher stimulation or adjuvants), use of donor eggs when appropriate, embryo freezing for future use, and fertility-preserving measures before gonadotoxic treatment. Lifestyle optimization and addressing reversible factors (smoking cessation, weight management, treating thyroid disease) can help general fertility health but can’t reverse age-related decline. Counseling about realistic expectations and individualized planning with a fertility specialist is essential when managing low egg reserve.
